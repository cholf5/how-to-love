# How to (make games with) LÖVE
How to (make games  with) LÖVE is a tutorial series made by me, Sheepolution. I decided to put it on Github so that others can contribute by fixing grammar-errors, code-errors or improvements on wording and explanation.

The tutorial is hosted on [sheepolution.com/learn/book](http://www.sheepolution.com/learn/book/contents).

[Parsedown](http://parsedown.org/tests/) is used to convert markdown to html.

## Static book reader

This repository now ships with a standalone static reader. Open `index.html` with any modern browser (or host the folder on GitHub Pages) to browse the book with language switching, theme toggle and client-side markdown rendering. The reader loads the Markdown files from `book/en` and `book/zh-cn`.

## 简体中文

`book/zh-cn/` 包含整套教程的简体中文版本，与英文原稿的章节一一对应。


## Planned chapters (random order)

* Tweening
* Terminology
* Clean code
* Physics
* ECS
* Networking

If you have more ideas for chapters, you can open an issue about it.
