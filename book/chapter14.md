# Chapter 14 - Game: Shoot the enemy

Let's use everything we learned so far to create a simple game. You can read about programming and making games all you want, but to really learn it you'll have to do it.

A game is essentially a bunch of problems that you have to solve. When you ask an experienced programmer to make PONG, he won't look up a *How to make PONG*. They can divide PONG into separate problems, and know how to solve each one of them. This chapter is to show you how to split a game into multiple tasks.

The game we'll be making is simple: An enemy is bouncing against the walls. We have to shoot it. Each time we shoot it, the enemy goes a little faster. When you miss, it's game over and you'll have to start over again.

For this game we're going to use images. You're free to use your own images, but I'm going to use these 3:

![](/images/book/14/panda.png)
![](/images/book/14/snake.png)
![](/images/book/14/bullet.png)

These images are made by [Kenney](http://kenney.nl/assets), who makes a lot of free assets that anyone can use in their games. Check him out!

Let's start with the 3 main callbacks, and load *classic*, the library we use to simulate classes.

```lua
function love.load()
	Object = require "classic"
end

function love.update(dt)

end

function love.draw()

end
```

Let's start with the player. Create a new file called `player.lua`.

We could make a baseclass for all our objects, but because it's such a short simple game we'll do without one. Though I encourage you to improve the code at the end of this chapter by adding a baseclass yourself.

## Task: Create a moving player

Create a Player class:

```lua
--! file: player.lua
Player = Object:extend()

function Player:new()

end
```

I'm going to give the panda image to my player.


```lua
function Player:new()
	self.image = love.graphics.newImage("panda.png")
end


function Player:draw()
	love.graphics.draw(self.image)
end
```

Next let's make it possible to move our player with our arrow keys.

```lua
function Player:new()
	self.image = love.graphics.newImage("panda.png")
	self.x = 300
	self.y = 20
	self.speed = 500
	self.width = self.image:getWidth() 
end

function Player:update(dt)
	if love.keyboard.isDown("left") then
		self.x = self.x - self.speed * dt
	elseif love.keyboard.isDown("right") then
		self.x = self.x + self.speed * dt
	end
end

function Player:draw()
	love.graphics.draw(self.image, self.x, self.y)
end
```

And now we should be able to move our player. Let's go back to `main.lua` and load our player.

```lua
--! file: main.lua
function love.load()
    Object = require "classic"
    require "player"

    player = Player()
end

function love.update(dt)
	player:update(dt)
end

function love.draw()
	player:draw()
end
```

As you can see, we can move our player. But our player can move out of the window. Let's fix this with if-statements.

```lua
--! file: player.lua

function Player:update(dt)
	if love.keyboard.isDown("left") then
		self.x = self.x - self.speed * dt
	elseif love.keyboard.isDown("right") then
		self.x = self.x + self.speed * dt
	end

	--Get the width of the window
	local window_width = love.graphics.getWidth()

	--If the x is too far too the left then..
	if self.x < 0 then
		--Set x to 0
		self.x = 0

	--Else, if the x is too far to the right then..
	elseif self.x > window_width then
		--Set the x to the window's width.
		self.x = window_width
	end
end
```

Oops, our player can still move too far to the right. We need to include our width when checking if we're hitting the right wall.

```lua
--If the left side is too far too the left then..
if self.x < 0 then
	--Set x to 0
	self.x = 0

--Else, if the right side is too far to the right then..
elseif self.x + self.width > window_width then
	--Set the right side to the window's width.
	self.x = window_width - self.width
end
```

And now it's fixed. Our player can't move out of the window anymore.

## Task: Create a moving enemy

Now let's make the Enemy class. Create a new file called `enemy.lua`, and type the following:

```lua
--! file: enemy.lua
Enemy = Object:extend()

function Enemy:new()


end
```

I'm going to give the enemy the snake image, and make it move by itself.


```lua
function Enemy:new()
	self.image = love.graphics.newImage("snake.png")
	self.x = 325
	self.y = 450
    self.speed = 100
end

function Enemy:update(dt)
	self.x = self.x + self.speed * dt 
end

function Enemy:draw()
	love.graphics.draw(self.image, self.x, self.y)
end
```

We need to make the enemy bounce against the walls, but let's load it first.

```lua
--! file: main.lua
function love.load()
    Object = require "classic"
    require "player"
    require "enemy"

    player = Player()
    enemy = Enemy()
end

function love.update(dt)
	player:update(dt)
	enemy:update(dt)
end

function love.draw()
	player:draw()
	enemy:draw()
end
```

Okay now we can see the enemy move, and we can see it move out of our window. Let's make sure it doesn't move out of our window like with Player.

```lua
function Enemy:new()
	self.image = love.graphics.newImage("snake.png")
	self.x = 325
	self.y = 450
    self.speed = 100
    self.width = self.image:getWidth()
    self.height = self.image:getHeight()
end

function Enemy:update(dt)
	self.x = self.x + self.speed * dt

	local window_width = love.graphics.getWidth()

	if self.x < 0 then
		self.x = 0
	elseif self.x + self.width > window_width then
		self.x = window_width - self.width
	end
end
```

Our enemy stops at the wall, but we want to make it bounce. How are we going to make it do that? It hits the right wall, and then what? It should move to the other direction. How do we make it move to the other direction? By changing the value of `speed`. And what should the value of `speed` become? It shouldn't be 100 but -100.

So should we do `self.speed = -100`? Well no. Because like I said before we'll make the enemy speed up as it gets hit, and this way it would reset its speed when it bounces. Instead, we should invert the value of `speed`. So `speed` becomes `-speed`. In other words, if the speed were to be increased to 120, it would then become -120.

And what if it hits the left wall? At that point speed is a negative number, and we should turn it into a positive number. How can we do that? Well, [negative times negative makes positive](https://www.khanacademy.org/math/algebra-basics/basic-alg-foundations/alg-basics-negative-numbers/v/why-a-negative-times-a-negative-is-a-positive). So if we say that `speed`, which at that point is a negative number, becomes `-speed`, it will turn into a positive number.

```lua
function Enemy:update(dt)
	self.x = self.x + self.speed * dt

	local window_width = love.graphics.getWidth()

	if self.x < 0 then
		self.x = 0
		self.speed = -self.speed
	elseif self.x + self.width > window_width then
		self.x = window_width - self.width
		self.speed = -self.speed
	end
end
```

Alright we got a player and a moving enemy, now all that's left is the bullet.

___

## Task: Be able to shoot bullets

Create a new file called `bullet.lua`, and write the following code:

```lua
--! file: bullet.lua

Bullet = Object:extend()

function Bullet:new()
	self.image = love.graphics.newImage("bullet.png")
end

function Bullet:draw()
	love.graphics.draw(self.image)
end
```

The bullets should move vertical instead of horizontal.

```lua
--We pass the x and y of the player.
function Bullet:new(x, y)
	self.image = love.graphics.newImage("bullet.png")
	self.x = x
	self.y = y
	self.speed = 700
	--We'll need these for collision checking
	self.width = self.image:getWidth()
	self.height = self.image:getHeight()
end

function Bullet:update(dt)
	self.y = self.y + self.speed * dt
end

function Bullet:draw()
	love.graphics.draw(self.image, self.x, self.y)
end
```

Now we need to be able to shoot bullets. In main.lua load the file and create a table.

```lua
--! file: main.lua
function love.load()
    Object = require "classic"
    require "player"
    require "enemy"
    require "bullet"

    player = Player()
    enemy = Enemy()
    listOfBullets = {}
end
```

Now we give Player a function that creates a bullet when space is pressed.

```lua
--! file: player.lua
function Player:keyPressed(key)
	--If the spacebar is pressed
	if key == "space" then
		--Put a new instance of Bullet inside listOfBullets.
		table.insert(listOfBullets, Bullet(self.x, self.y))
	end
end
```

And we need to call this function in the `love.keypressed` callback.

```lua
--! file: main.lua
function love.keypressed(key)
	player:keyPressed(key)
end
```

And now we need to iterate through the table and update/draw all the bullets.

```
function love.load()
    Object = require "classic"
    require "player"
    require "enemy"
    require "bullet"

    player = Player()
    enemy = Enemy()
    listOfBullets = {}
end

function love.update(dt)
	player:update(dt)
	enemy:update(dt)

	for i,v in ipairs(listOfBullets) do
		v:update(dt)
	end
end

function love.draw()
	player:draw()
	enemy:draw()
	
	for i,v in ipairs(listOfBullets) do
		v:draw()
	end
end
```
Awesome, our player can now shoot bullets. 

___

## Task: Make bullets affect the enemy's speed

Now we need to make it so that the snake can get hit by the bullet. We give Bullet a collision detection function.

```lua
--! file: bullet.lua
function Bullet:checkCollision(obj)

end
```

Do you still know how to do it? Do you still know the 4 conditions that need to be true to assure collision is happening?

Instead of returning true and false, we increase the enemy's speed. We give the property `dead` to the bullet, which we'll use to remove it from the list.

```lua
function Bullet:checkCollision(obj)
    local self_left = self.x
    local self_right = self.x + self.width
    local self_top = self.y
    local self_bottom = self.y + self.height

    local obj_left = obj.x
    local obj_right = obj.x + obj.width
    local obj_top = obj.y
    local obj_bottom = obj.y + obj.height

    if self_right > obj_left and
    self_left < obj_right and
    self_bottom > obj_top and
    self_top < obj_bottom then
        self.dead = true

        --Increase enemy speed
        obj.speed = obj.speed + 50
    end
end
```


Now we need to call checkCollision in main.lua.

```lua
function love.update(dt)
	player:update(dt)
	enemy:update(dt)

	for i,v in ipairs(listOfBullets) do
		v:update(dt)

		--Each bullets checks if there is collision with the enemy
		v:checkCollision(enemy)
	end
end
```

And next we need to destroy the bullets that are dead.

```lua
function love.update(dt)
	player:update(dt)
	enemy:update(dt)

	for i,v in ipairs(listOfBullets) do
		v:update(dt)
		v:checkCollision(enemy)

		--If the bullet has the property dead and it's true then..
		if v.dead then
			--Remove it from the list
			table.remove(listOfBullets, i)
		end
	end
end
```

Last thing to do is to restart the game when we miss the enemy. We need to check if the bullet is out of the screen.


```lua
--! file: bullet.lua
function Bullet:update(dt)
	self.y = self.y + self.speed * dt

	--If the bullet is out of the screen
	if self.y > love.graphics.getHeight() then
		--Restart the game
		love.load()
	end
end
```

And let's test it out. You might notice that when you hit the enemy while it's moving to the left, it slows down. This is because the enemy's speed is at that point a negative number. So by increasing the number the enemy slows down. To fix this we need to check if the enemy's speed is a negative number or not.

```lua
function Bullet:checkCollision(obj)
    local self_left = self.x
    local self_right = self.x + self.width
    local self_top = self.y
    local self_bottom = self.y + self.height

    local obj_left = obj.x
    local obj_right = obj.x + obj.width
    local obj_top = obj.y
    local obj_bottom = obj.y + obj.height

    if self_right > obj_left and
    self_left < obj_right and
    self_bottom > obj_top and
    self_top < obj_bottom then
        self.dead = true

        --Increase enemy speed
        if obj.speed > 0 then
	        obj.speed = obj.speed + 50
	    else
	    	obj.speed = obj.speed - 50
	    end
    end
end
```

And with that our game is finished. Or is it? You should try adding features to the game yourself. Or make a whole new game. It doesn't matter as long as you keep learning and keep making games!

## Summary
A game is essentially a bunch of problems that need to be solved.
